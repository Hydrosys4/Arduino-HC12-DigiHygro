# Arduino-HC12-DigiHygro
This Arduino Code (format for PLatformIO) will create an interface with the HC-12 for long range wireless transmission and the Digital Hygrometer for the Soil moisture sensor or the Analog inputs of the arduino. 

The files in the folder:
- HC-12encoding_x.x is used to interface the Digital Soil moisture sensor (https://www.tindie.com/products/angelova/digital-soil-moisture-sensor-for-raspberry-pi/)
- HC-12encoding_analog_x.x is used to read the analog inputs of the arduino

This is part of a larger project called Hydrosys4: https://hydrosysblog.wordpress.com/
